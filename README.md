## Keras-Primer

During the course of producing a Neural Network pipeline for a project I worked on over the summer I spent many hours researching MLP's and the Keras library. For anyone who has tried implementing their own MLP structures in theano, you will understand how difficult this can be sometimes and the level of programming skill required. Keras removes all these obstacles and makes the productions of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's) incredibly simple. Additionally the user can now choose to run theano or tensorflow as the backend package.

To aid my own understanding and to potentially help others become familiar with Keras and the incredible variety of functionality this package offers I have written some notebooks which will hopefully help beginners and intermediates improve their fluency with building neural networks.

NB: I have only concentrated on MLP's, other resources can be found to understand CNN's, RNN's and encoders.
